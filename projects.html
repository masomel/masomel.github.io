<li><div><i>Continuity of identity in the untrusted cloud</i>, Jan 2013 - present</div>
</li>
<div class="descrip">
Advisors: Prof. Michael Freedman, Prof. Edward Felten<br/>
Collaborator: Aaron Blankstein<br/>
<br/>
This is my Master's thesis project. The goal is to design a certification system for secure communications 
with an untrusted cloud provider. In particular, our system provides continuity of name-to-key bindings, or otherwise makes any violation of this continuity easily detectable. Central to our system are misbehavior detection mechanisms, as well as algorithms for verifying the integrity of name-to-key bindings.

<br/>
This is the extension on work that started as the final group project for the Privacy Technologies course I took with Prof. Arvind Narayanan in the Fall 2012 semester. The goal of our work was to survey web tracking practices via web browsing on mobile devices, and to compare these practices with the findings of the <a href="fourthparty.info">FourthParty project</a>.
<br/><br/>
We published a paper on this project in the Web 2.0 Security and Privacy workshop: "Shining the Floodlights on Mobile Web Tracking â€” A Privacy Survey" (<a href="http://w2spconf.com/2013/papers/s2p2.pdf">pdf</a>)

<li><div><i>ELARA: Environmental Liaison and Automated Recycling Assistant</i>, Aug 2011 - April 2012</div>
</li>
<div class="descrip">
Advisor: Prof. John Vaughn<br/>
<br/>
This was my Honors project in CS at HWS. The primary goal was to design and create a system to improve environmental recycling, as many people often do a poor job at identifying the materials which can be recycled. Thus, my project included two approaches to help solve this issue: (1) leverage the general public's knowledge about recyclables at a website to help identify recyclable items (aka crowdsourcing), and (2) build a networked kiosk to help users separate their waste correctly. I did some preliminary work on this project over the summer of 2011.<br/>
Throughout my last two semesters as an undergraduate, I implemented the final design of the kiosk application, and built the hardware platform on which my program runs. Although I have graduated and completed this project with Honors, I plan to continue working on some aspects of this project during the next few years as well.

During this summer research project, I designed what is now the ELARA project. I first conducted extensive research on crowdsourcing to learn of ways to motivate a large crowd to become part of an online project. 
<br/>The second major component of this project was to design and build a hardware and software system that makes use of the crowd's knowledge about recycling to assist others in sorting garbage correctly. This system is comprised of a networked embedded computer with a Java application running on it representing a recycling assistant, and the system website which provides the space where users can contribute to the project and track of their recycling progress.

<li><div><i>Using FPGAs to create a Complete Computer System for the Classroom</i>, June 2010 - Aug 2010</div>

<div class="descrip">
Advisor: Prof. Marc Corliss<br/>
<br/>
The primary objective of this project was to use a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), a software configurable device, to replace a simulator with an actual hardware platform students can easily use in several computer science courses. The motivation for this project was to help solve the often-arising problem in computer systems education students must work with overly complex commercial systems, or use unrealistic simulators/emulators when learning how a computer works and how to build one. In order to create this computer system, I designed and then implemented a 16-bit educational processor according to an ISA called <a href="http://math.hws.edu/mcorliss/larc">Larc</a> on an FPGA using Verilog. After the basic processor was working, I incrementally added support for I/O devices (keyboard, monitor and disk) and for an educational OS called Vireos. At the end of the summer, a Unix-based shell featuring all major functionalities of common shells such as redirection and piping, was able to run on my computer system.
<br/><br/>
Prof. Corliss and I published a paper in conjunction with this project at the 2011 SIGCSE Conference: "Vireos: an Integrated, Bottom-up Educational Operating Systems Project with FPGA support" (<a href="http://math.hws.edu/mcorliss/papers/sigcse11.pdf">pdf</a>)

<br/>
This project was part of a part-time internship I did in the Spring 2011 for a new local running relay race in Geneva, NY. I was first asked to help build the website together with a fellow CS student from HWS. <br/>
The second, and larger part, of the internship was to design and create a web-based real-time race tracking program to track the runners. My partner and I first set up the database for our program and then developed the client-side web application (using Google Maps) and the server-side scripts.

<li><div><i>The Seneca Saga (for Games4Girls competition)</i>, Oct 2009 - April 2010</div>

<div class="descrip">
won Honorable Mention<br/>
<br/>
This was my second year participating in the Games4Girls competition as part of a team. The goal was to create a computer game geared towards teenage girls.
For this year, we designed and developed a role-playing game. The player slips into the role of a young princess who goes on a quest and travels across two lands to save her kingdom from a war with the neighboring kingdom. In the end, she must face and defeat the evil sorcerer who is behind all these events. <br/>
I created one of the 5 stages of the game, and helped with the game scripts written in a C-like language. I also compiled the musical pieces for our game.
