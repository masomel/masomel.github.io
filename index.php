<p>
I am currently a first-year PhD student in the CS Department at Princeton University. My advisor is <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten\">Ed Felten</a>. My research interests are computer security, systems, networks, and applied cryptography. 
</p>

<p>
I recevied my M.S.E in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed\">Mike Freedman</a>. My Master's thesis was on a key management system for end-to-end encrypted communications.</p>

<p>I received my B.S. in <b>Computer Science</b>, with a Minor in <b>Physics</b> from <a href=\"http://www.hws.edu\">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> (HWS) in Geneva, NY in May 2012. I worked on two major research projects in Systems. In particular, I worked on a Computer Architecture project (LARC) and an Embedded Computing/Systems Engineering project (ELARA). I primarily worked with <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/vaughn\">John Vaughn</a> and <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/web/faculty/corliss\">Marc Corliss</a>.

<p>
 I consider myself a very multicultural person. My parents are from El Salvador, I'm from Miami, FL, but I grew up in a rural town near Munich, Germany. I also have an affinity for Francophone cultures, so in college, I majored in French and Francophone Studies as well. 
</p>

<p>
In recent days, I spend most of my free time practicing and competing in Taekwondo with <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~tkd\">Princeton Taekwondo</a>. In my spare time, I also love to cook and bake, and enjoy a pot of tea or a tasty meal with friends. I wish I had more time to play the piano or learn a new instrument, to read, and to travel. Whenever I find time to read, I usually choose articles on science and technology, gender or environmental issues, and novels by all sorts of authors from all sorts of eras. Currently, I'm reading Bruce Schneier's Secrets and Lies, as well as The Once and Future King by T.H. White.
