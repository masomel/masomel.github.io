<div class=\"inner\">
<p>
I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University working with <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed\">Mike Freedman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten\">Ed Felten</a>. My research interests are communication and OS security.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I recevied my M.S.E in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and Mike Freedman. My Master's thesis was on the design of a practical key management system for end users.</p>

<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics from <a href=\"http://www.hws.edu\">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> (HWS) in Geneva, NY in May 2012. I worked on two major research projects in Systems with <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/vaughn\">John Vaughn</a> and <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/web/faculty/corliss\">Marc Corliss</a>.

Design and build a tool to detect malicious scripts in web pages served via HTTP relying on machine 
learning to automate the detection process. We are currently collecting and analyzing HTTP web page data
as seen from many different geo-locations to find anomalous and suspicious scripts.

<p>
I am from Miami, Florida, but I lived in a rural town near Munich, Germany for eleven years.
I grew up in a bilingual household (Spanish-English), am fluent in German, and
I studied French for 9 years.
</p>

<p>
In terms of hobbies, I am interested in a wide variety of sports: 
I play tennis (competitively during middle
school and high school), I have a black belt in Taekwondo (first Dan WTF), and
enjoy alpine skiing in the winter. More
recently I have begun practicing Yoga and rock climbing. Topics I like to read about
include science (broadly defined), green living and renewable energy, and
gender issues. Other interests I have are fanatsy/sci-fi books/TV shows/games, 
hiking/camping and cooking.
