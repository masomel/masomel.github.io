<p>
I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University working with <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten\">Ed Felten</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed\">Mike Freedman</a>. My research interests are security, systems, networks, and applied cryptography. 
</p>

<p>
Previously, I recevied my M.S.E in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and Mike Freedman. My Master's thesis was on a key management system for end-to-end encrypted communication.</p>

<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics from <a href=\"http://www.hws.edu\">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> (HWS) in Geneva, NY in May 2012. I worked on two major research projects in Systems. In particular, I worked on a Computer Architecture project and an Embedded Computing/Systems project. I primarily worked with <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/vaughn\">John Vaughn</a> and <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/web/faculty/corliss\">Marc Corliss</a>.

<li><div><i>Multisurf</i></div>
</li>
<div class=\"descrip\">
Detect in-flight modifications to web pages, and differentiate malicious changes from
regular dynamic web page content (e.g., malicious script injection vs. locality-based
ads).
</br>

</div>

<li><div><i>CONIKS: Practical Key Management for End Users</i></div>
</li>
<div class=\"descrip\">
This was my MSE thesis project, which I have continued expanding.<br/>
Design and build a practical key verification service for end-user public encryption keys.
We achieve this via publicly-auditable, privacy preserving key directories that 
periodically generate cryptographic &quot;snapshots&quot; of the current state making it
possible for CONIKS clients to detect spurious keys or inconsistent views
of any one key directory in an efficient manner.<br/>

<p>
<ul>
<li><div><i>Web Transparency Project: Mobile Web Tracking Survey</i></div>
</li>
<div class=\"descrip\">
Compare tracking practices of desktop web browsing with those of mobile web browsing,
and determine mobile-specific tracking characteristics.<br/>
<a href=\"http://webtransparency.org\">Web Transparency website</a>
</div>

<li><div><i>ELARA: Environmental Liaison and Automated Recycling Assistant</i></div>
</li>
<div class=\"descrip\">
This was my Senior Honors thesis project.<br/>
Design and build an automated recycling system which assists users in recycling 
when discarding waste at dedicated kiosks by informing the user if their item is
recyclable, compostable, or landfill garbage. Information about waste items
is collected via crowdsourcing, and used by the kiosks.
</div>

<li><div><i>Using FPGAs to create a Complete Computer System for the Classroom</i></div>
</li>
<div class=\"descrip\">
Implement a 16-bit intruction set architecture designed for educational purposes on an 
FPGA. Add support for a simple operating system and basic peripheral devices.
</div>

</ul>

<span class=\"label_blue\">Personal</span><hr class=\"line\"/>
<p>
I am from Miami, Florida, but I lived in a rural town near Munich, Germany for eleven years.
I grew up in a bilingual household (Spanish-English), am fluent in German, and
I studied French for 9 years.
</p>

<p>
In terms of hobbies, I am interested in a wide variety of sports: 
I play tennis (competitively during middle
school and high school), I have a black belt in Taekwondo (first Dan WTF), and
enjoy alpine skiing in the winter. More
recently I have begun practicing Yoga and rock climbing. Topics I like to read about
include science (broadly defined), green living and renewable energy, and
gender issues. Other interests I have are fanatsy/sci-fi books/TV shows/games, 
hiking/camping and cooking.
