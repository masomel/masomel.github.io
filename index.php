<div class=\"inner\">
<p>
I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University working with <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten\">Ed Felten</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed\">Mike Freedman</a>. My research interests are security, systems, networks, and applied cryptography. 
</p>

<p>
Previously, I recevied my M.S.E in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and Mike Freedman. My Master's thesis was on a key management system for end-to-end encrypted communication.</p>

<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics from <a href=\"http://www.hws.edu\">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> (HWS) in Geneva, NY in May 2012. I worked on two major research projects in Systems with <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/vaughn\">John Vaughn</a> and <a href=\"http://math.hws.edu/web/faculty/corliss\">Marc Corliss</a>.

<div class=\"project_name\">Multisurf</div>
Detect in-flight modifications to web pages, and differentiate malicious changes from
regular dynamic web page content (e.g., malicious script injection vs. locality-based
ads).

<p>
<div class=\"project_name\">CONIKS: Practical Key Management for End Users</div>
This was my MSE thesis project, which I have continued expanding.<br/>
Design and build a practical key verification service for end-user public encryption keys.
We achieve this via publicly-auditable, privacy preserving key directories that 
periodically generate cryptographic &quot;snapshots&quot; of the current state making it
possible for CONIKS clients to detect spurious keys or inconsistent views
of any one key directory in an efficient manner.<br/>

<div class=\"inner\">
<p>
I am from Miami, Florida, but I lived in a rural town near Munich, Germany for eleven years.
I grew up in a bilingual household (Spanish-English), am fluent in German, and
I studied French for 9 years.
</p>

<p>
In terms of hobbies, I am interested in a wide variety of sports: 
I play tennis (competitively during middle
school and high school), I have a black belt in Taekwondo (first Dan WTF), and
enjoy alpine skiing in the winter. More
recently I have begun practicing Yoga and rock climbing. Topics I like to read about
include science (broadly defined), green living and renewable energy, and
gender issues. Other interests I have are fanatsy/sci-fi books/TV shows/games, 
hiking/camping and cooking.
