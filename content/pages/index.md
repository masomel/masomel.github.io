I'm a second-year PhD student in Princeton's <a class="text-info" href="https://security.cs.princeton.edu">Security and Privacy Research Group</a> and the <a class="text-info" href="http://sns.cs.princeton.edu">S* Network Systems Group</a>. I'm also a Graduate Student Fellow at Princeton's <a class="text-info" href="https://citp.princeton.edu">Center for Information Technology Policy</a>. My research focuses primarily on security, operating systems and networks. I especially enjoy building systems that provide strong security and privacy despite running in untrusted environments.

<p>Previously, I recevied my M.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and Mike Freedman. My Master's thesis was on <a class="text-info" href="https://coniks.cs.princeton.edu">CONIKS</a>, a practical key management system for end users, which is run by untrusted key servers.</p>

<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics from <a class="text-info" href="http://www.hws.edu">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> (HWS) in Geneva, NY in May 2012.
