I'm a fifth-year PhD student working with Mike Freedman in the <a class="text-info" href="http://sns.cs.princeton.edu">S* Network Systems Group</a>. In tha past, I have collaborated with folks in the <a class="text-info" href="https://security.cs.princeton.edu">Security and Privacy Group</a> and Princeton's <a class="text-info" href="https://citp.princeton.edu">Center for Information Technology Policy</a>. My current research focuses primarily on security and operating systems.
</p>

<p>Staring in the Fall, I will be starting as a Research Scientist at the Intel Labs Security and Privacy Research group, where I was Graduate Intern on the Trusted Distributed Systems team Summer 2018. A few years ago, I was an OS Security Engineering Intern on the CoreOS team at Apple.</p>

<p>Previously, I received my M.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and Mike Freedman. My Master's thesis was on a practical key management system for end users, which is run by untrusted key servers (an early version of <a class="text-info" href="https://coniks.cs.princeton.edu">CONIKS</a>).
</p/>

<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics from <a class="text-info" href="http://www.hws.edu">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> in May 2012.
