I am a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Princeton University working with <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed">Mike Freedman</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten">Ed Felten</a>. In my research, I seek to build systems that provide strong security while operating in untrusted environments.
</p>

<p>Previously, I recevied my M.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and Mike Freedman. My Master's thesis was on <a href="http://coniks.org">CONIKS</a>, a practical key management system for end users, which is run by untrusted key servers.</p>

<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics from <a href="http://www.hws.edu">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> (HWS) in Geneva, NY in May 2012.
