I'm a Research Scientist in the Security and Privacy Research group at Intel Labs. I
currently also serve on the Technical Advisory Council of the
<a class="text-info" href="https://openssf.org>OpenSSF</a>. I broadly work on building
trustworthy distributed systems, where I apply techniques from operating systems, networks,
cryptography and hardware-based security to improve the auditability and security of deployed
large-scale systems. I'm also a firm believer in highly collaborative, open projects and in
faciliating practical adoption of my research.

<p>My current work centers on <a class="text-info" href="https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/predicates/scai.md">verifiable attribute assertions</a> for software and
trusted execution environments, as well as auditing of CI/CD systems.
My research on <a class="text-info" href="https://coniks.org">CONIKS</a>, a key transparency system
that makes the issuance of secure messaging encryption keys cryptographically auditable, is
used in production including by
<a class="text-info" href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/">Meta</a> and
<a class="text-info" href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification/">Apple</a> in their messaging apps.

<p>Prior to joining Intel, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Princeton
University where I developed novel techniques for fine-grained run-time access control and
compartmentalization of application- and OS-level components, advised by
<a class="text-info" href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed/">Mike Freedman</a> in the
<a class="text-info" href="http://sns.cs.princeton.edu">S* Network Systems Group</a>. I also
had the pleasure of collaborating closely with
<a class="text-info" href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/felten">Ed Felten</a>
on my Master's thesis. I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a second Major in
French and Francophone Studies and a Minor in Physics from
<a class="text-info" href="http://www.hws.edu">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a>.
