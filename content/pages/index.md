I'm a Research Scientist in the Security and Privacy Research group at Intel Labs. I boradly work on building trustworthy distributed systems, with a focus on software supply chain provenance and cloud computing.

<p>Previously, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Princeton University in September 2019, where I worked with Mike Freedman in the <a class="text-info" href="http://sns.cs.princeton.edu">S* Network Systems Group</a>. I received my M.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton in June 2014, and was co-advised by Ed Felten and Mike Freedman. My Master's thesis was on a practical key management system for end users, which is run by untrusted key servers (an early version of <a class="text-info" href="https://coniks.cs.princeton.edu">CONIKS</a>).

<p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science, with a Minor in Physics from <a class="text-info" href="http://www.hws.edu">Hobart and William Smith Colleges</a> in May 2012.
