<span class="title">Intra-process sandboxing</span> is a new sandboxing
system for preventing data leaks in IoT devices specifically
caused by untrusted third-party code included in IoT applications.
As a first step, our analysis of IoT applications shows that IoT developers
rely very heavily on third-party software downloaded from
various online sources to build their applications. Despite their best
effort, developers may still <i>unintentionally</i> include malicious
third-party code, which may attempt to leak private sensor data to an
unintended remote server. To address this problem, our system allows
IoT developers to easily specify different sensor and data access
permissions for the various third-party libraries and tools used in
their applications, while our system enforces these access rules at the
intra-process granularity in the operating system at runtime.

In the <span class="title">Stormship</span> project, we aim to study in-flight
web page modifications today, and to develop a browser-side tool that
detects malicious web page modifications automatically. In a preliminrary
measurement study, we have found that page properties such as the number
of scripts included in a web page HTML source vary greatly between different
geographic locations. Our next step is to more closely characterize the
changes made to web pages in-transit between the server and browser.

<span class="title"><a class="text-info" href="https://coniks.cs.princeton.edu">CONIKS</a></span>
is key management system for end users that improves the security and privacy of end-to-end secure communication services. By having communication service providers maintain tamper-evident and publicly auditable key directories on behalf of their users, CONIKS allows secure communication clients to verify users' keys automatically so users do not have to worry about the underlying encryption or trust their service provider to be well-behaved.
<br/>
Our <a class="text-info" href="static/pubs/sec15-paper-melara.pdf">paper</a> on CONIKS won the 2017 Caspar Bowden PET Award.
<br/>
I wrote my Master's thesis on an early version of CONIKS.

<p>As a Master's student and undergraduate, I also worked on several <a class="text-info" href="prior-projects.html">prior projects</a>.
