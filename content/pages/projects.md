Here's a summary of my ongoing and recent research projects. You can also visit my <a class='text-info' href="https://github.com/marcelamelara">Github page</a> to see what OSS projects I contribute to.

<h4 class="text-primary">Code Deployment Integrity</h4><hr class="line"/>
<div class="inner">
<p>CDI is a framework for capturing and verifying high-integrity provenance metadata about software artifacts.
By collecting evidence about the integrity of the operators in a software supply chain (i.e., the compiler, CI/CD pipeline etc),
CDI enables verifiers to reduce trust in the operators themselves, and provides stronger assurances about the integrity of the provenance metadata they produce. </p>

<p>For more details, I encourage you to look at my publications on this project.</p>

<h4 class="text-primary">EnclaveDom</h4><hr class="line"/>
<div class="inner">
<p>EnclaveDom is a compartmentalization system for large-TCB TEE applications that partitions an enclave into tagged memory regions, and enforces per-region access rules at the granularity of individual in-enclave functions. EnclaveDom is implemented on Intel SGX using Memory Protection Keys (MPK) for memory tagging, and we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of our compartmentalization mechanism in the Graphene-SGX libOS.</p>

<p>You can find all the details in our paper:</p>
