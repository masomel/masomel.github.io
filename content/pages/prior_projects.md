Here's a summary of some older research projects I worked on during my time at Princeton and HWS.
You can find the code for some of these projects at my personal <a class='text-info' href="https://github.com/masomel">Github page</a>.

<p> <span class="title">Pyronia</span> is an intra-process compartmentalization system 
for interpreted languages.
Whenever an application attempts to access a system resource, our
in-kernel system call monitor enforces a developer-supplied library access policy for that
resource. Using the application runtime's current callstack as the context
for the access, the monitor determines whether to allow the access
according to the permissions given to the libraries found in the callstack.

<a class="text-info" href="https://coniks.cs.princeton.edu">CONIKS</a> is a key management system for end
users that improves the security and privacy of end-to-end secure
communication services. By having communication service providers maintain
tamper-evident and publicly auditable key directories on behalf of their
users, CONIKS allows secure communication clients to verify users' keys
automatically so users do not have to worry about the underlying encryption
or trust their service provider to be well-behaved.

This research was awarded the Caspar Bowden PET Award in 2017.

The <span class="title">Mobile Web Tracking Survey</span>
compares mobile web tracking practices with web tracking on desktops. Using a web crawler based on <a class="text-info" href="http://fourthparty.info">FourthParty</a>, we gathered web tracking data, such as cookies, on popular mobile devices.
<br/>
This work was the first major study of what is now the <a class="text-info" href="https://webtap.princeton.edu">Princeton Web Transparency and Accountability Project</a>.

<span class="title">ELARA</span>
is a recycling and waste management service that helps users separate their waste correctly leveraging a crowd-sourced database of waste items to assist users in identifying the correct waste bin for their items. ELARA's interactive recycling kiosks also allow users to track their usage and progress.
<br/>
The design and implementation of this system are described in my Senior Honors thesis.

The <span class="title">Vireos Computer</span>
is an educational FPGA-based platform for computer architecture and operating systems courses. Based on the 16-bit educational architecture Larc, the Vireos computer supports basic I/O devices and peripherals, and is capable of running a Unix-based shell in the Vireos educational OS.

I presented this work at the 2011 New York Conference for Women in Computing (NYCWiC).
