I am Salvadoran-American from Miami, Florida, currently living in the Portland, OR area. I also lived in Germany for over a decade. I'm fluent in English, Spanish, and German, and decent at French, which I studied once upon a time in high school and college.</p>
<p> 
These days, I spend most of my free time hanging out with my family and two dogs, taking care of my plantitas, reading books (mostly fantasy and history), writing fiction or poetry, hiking, or playing DnD. I'm also a huge language nerd, so one of my newest past-times is learning Japanese.
