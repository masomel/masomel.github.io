I am a Salvadoran-American from Miami, Florida, currently living in the Portland, OR area. I also lived in Germany for over a decade. I'm fluent in English, Spanish, and German, and conversational in French, which I studied once upon a time in high school and college.</p>

These days, I spend most of my free time hanging out with my family, two dogs, hiking or gardening, reading books, or playing board games. My newest hobby is learning Japanese.
