I'm Salvadoran-American currently living in the Portland, OR area.
I also lived in Germany for over a decade. I'm fluent in English, Spanish,
and German, and decent at French, which I studied once upon a time in high
school and college.
 
These days, I like to spend my free time with my family and two dogs, tending to
my garden, writing fiction and poetry, hiking, or trying my hand at new food
recipes. I'm also a huge language/linguistics nerd, so one of my current hobbies
is learning Japanese.
